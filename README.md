Final Exam Project for CP1

## Back Story
This is a game based on Cat Mario but involves in a Farm setting. With that being said the enemies are various
farm animals, the first ones you'll run into are a buffalo and cow (this is an odd farm, don't worry about it).

## How to Play
This is a fairly simple game. The goal of the game is to reach the flag within the three lives you have. You loose lives by touching enemies.The enemies all can take one hit but as the the number of enemies decreases, the speed of the remaining one increases. There are no power ups to help you but each egg that you get adds twenty points to your score. There are three different levels all with different challenges. You win the game by passing all of three levels. The controls are the arrow keys: 

left arrow = left
right arrow = right
space bar = jump
